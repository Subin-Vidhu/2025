<p>In the next lesson you will start seeing links to my Replit profile which will have code from the videos you will watch throughout the course. Sometimes, Replit servers can have issues/or be down, so please take note of <em>2 important things you can</em> do to make sure you can follow the course without interruptions:<br><br><strong>1. </strong>You can always find the Replit code on <a href="https://github.com/aneagoie/ztm-master-the-coding-interview-ds-algo" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>my github repo specific to this course right here</strong></a> so you have it in one place throughout the course. <br><br><strong>2.</strong> When you click on the link of a Replit project (like in the next lecture), you will see something similar to below. <strong>Make sure you&nbsp;CLICK&nbsp;ON&nbsp;THE&nbsp;"SHOW&nbsp;CODE" icon so you can see my code:<br></strong></p><figure><img src="https://img-c.udemycdn.com/redactor/raw/article_lecture/2023-12-16_23-23-15-cc0fdb8103480f2dd32c65ea29609554.png"></figure><p><strong><br><br>If you have any issues, please let us know in the #helpme channel on our Discord :)</strong></p>
