# AI/ML Technical Interview Questions and Answers

## AI Model Development

### 1. Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning

**Supervised Learning:**
Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model learns from labeled data. The algorithm is trained on a dataset where the correct output (label) is already known. Think of it like learning with a teacher who provides the correct answers.

Key characteristics:
- Requires paired input-output data for training
- Clear feedback on prediction accuracy
- Suitable for classification and regression tasks
- More commonly used in real-world applications

Common applications:
- Image classification
- Sentiment analysis
- Price prediction
- Medical diagnosis

Example: Email Spam Classification
In this example, we train a model to classify emails as spam or not spam based on their content:

```python
# Supervised Learning Example - Email Spam Classification
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.svm import SVC

# Sample data
emails = ["Buy now!", "Meeting tomorrow", "Win lottery!", "Project update"]
labels = [1, 0, 1, 0]  # 1: spam, 0: not spam

# Feature extraction
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(emails)
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, labels, test_size=0.2)

# Train model
model = SVC()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

**Unsupervised Learning:**
Unsupervised learning is where the model learns patterns from unlabeled data. It's like discovering hidden structures without any prior knowledge of what to look for.

Key characteristics:
- No labeled training data required
- Discovers hidden patterns and structures
- Used for clustering, dimensionality reduction, and anomaly detection
- More exploratory in nature

Common applications:
- Customer segmentation
- Anomaly detection
- Feature learning
- Recommendation systems

Example: Customer Segmentation
Here we group customers based on their behavior without predefined categories:

```python
# Unsupervised Learning Example - Customer Segmentation
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
import numpy as np

# Sample customer data: [purchase_amount, visit_frequency]
customers = np.array([
    [100, 5],
    [20, 2],
    [500, 10],
    [50, 3]
])

# Perform clustering
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=2)
segments = kmeans.fit_predict(customers)
```

### 2. Building ML Models for Healthcare

Building machine learning models for healthcare requires special consideration due to the critical nature of medical decisions and the sensitivity of patient data.

**Key Considerations:**

1. **Data Quality and Ethics:**
   - Ensure patient privacy and HIPAA compliance

```python
# Example of data preprocessing for healthcare
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

def preprocess_patient_data(data):
    # Handle missing values
    data = data.fillna(data.mean())
    
    # Normalize numerical features
    scaler = StandardScaler()
    numerical_cols = ['age', 'blood_pressure', 'glucose']
    data[numerical_cols] = scaler.fit_transform(data[numerical_cols])
    
    return data
```

### 3. Deep Learning Frameworks Experience

    def __init__(self):
        super(MedicalImageClassifier, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(3, 16, 3)
        self.pool = nn.MaxPool2d(2, 2)
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(16 * 62 * 62, 2)  # Binary classification
        
    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.pool(torch.relu(self.conv1(x)))
        x = x.view(-1, 16 * 62 * 62)
        x = self.fc1(x)
        return x

# Training loop example
def train_model(model, train_loader, criterion, optimizer):
    model.train()
    for images, labels in train_loader:
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        outputs = model(images)
        loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
```

### 4. Handling Class Imbalance

Class imbalance is a common challenge in machine learning, especially in healthcare where some conditions are rare. Here's a comprehensive approach to handling it:

**Understanding Class Imbalance:**
- Occurs when classes are not equally represented
- Common in medical diagnosis, fraud detection
- Can lead to biased models
- Requires special handling techniques

**Solution Strategies:**

1. **Data-level approaches:**
   - Oversampling minority class (SMOTE)
   - Undersampling majority class
   - Hybrid methods

2. **Algorithm-level approaches:**
   - Class weights
   - Custom loss functions
   - Ensemble methods

3. **Evaluation considerations:**
   - Use appropriate metrics (F1-score, AUC-ROC)
   - Consider domain-specific impact
   - Balance precision and recall

Implementation examples:

```python
# Oversampling example using SMOTE
from imblearn.over_sampling import SMOTE

def balance_dataset(X, y):
    smote = SMOTE(random_state=42)
    X_balanced, y_balanced = smote.fit_resample(X, y)
    return X_balanced, y_balanced

# Using class weights
from sklearn.utils.class_weight import compute_class_weight

def get_class_weights(y):
    weights = compute_class_weight('balanced', classes=np.unique(y), y=y)
    return dict(enumerate(weights))

# Custom weighted loss function
class WeightedBCELoss(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, weights):
        super(WeightedBCELoss, self).__init__()
        self.weights = weights
        
    def forward(self, pred, target):
        loss = -self.weights[target] * (target * torch.log(pred) + 
               (1 - target) * torch.log(1 - pred))
        return loss.mean()
```

### 5. Overfitting and Underfitting

Understanding and preventing overfitting and underfitting is crucial for building robust machine learning models.

**Overfitting:**
- Model learns noise in training data
- High training accuracy, low test accuracy
- Complex model relative to data amount
- Poor generalization to new data

**Underfitting:**
- Model too simple to capture patterns
- Low training and test accuracy
- Insufficient model capacity
- Poor performance on all datasets

**Prevention Strategies:**

1. **Cross-Validation:**
   - Helps detect overfitting early
   - Provides robust performance estimates
   - Guides model selection

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score

def evaluate_model(model, X, y):
    scores = cross_val_score(model, X, y, cv=5)
    print(f"Cross-validation scores: {scores}")
    print(f"Mean CV score: {scores.mean():.3f} (+/- {scores.std() * 2:.3f})")
```

2. **Regularization:**
   - Prevents complex models
   - L1/L2 regularization
   - Early stopping

```python
# L1/L2 Regularization example
from sklearn.linear_model import Ridge, Lasso

# L2 regularization
ridge_model = Ridge(alpha=0.1)

# L1 regularization
lasso_model = Lasso(alpha=0.1)
```

3. **Neural Network Specific:**
   - Dropout layers
   - Batch normalization
   - Data augmentation

```python
class RegularizedNN(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(RegularizedNN, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size)
        self.dropout = nn.Dropout(0.5)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(hidden_size, output_size)
        
    def forward(self, x):
        x = torch.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = self.dropout(x)
        return self.fc2(x)
```
