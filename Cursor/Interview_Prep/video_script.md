# Simple Video Introduction Script

## Introduction
"Hi! I'm Subin S, and I work as a Machine Learning Engineer. For the past three years, I've been working with AI in medical imaging. I studied Electronics and Communication Engineering at KTU University in Kerala, and I've worked at Aramis Imaging as an AI Developer and at ICT Academy of Kerala as a Data Science Analyst.

## What I Do
I build AI tools that help doctors and medical professionals. My main work is in medical imaging - things like analyzing kidney scans, spine images, and detecting tumors. I make sure these tools are not just accurate but also easy for doctors to use in their daily work.

## My Technical Skills
I mainly use Python for programming, and I'm good with tools like TensorFlow for AI development. I also know JavaScript and SQL, which helps me build complete solutions. I use popular data science tools like NumPy and Pandas, and I can build web applications using Flask and Django.

## My Main Projects
Let me tell you about some of my important projects and the tools I used to build them:

- AIRA (aira.protosonline.in): A system that helps doctors analyze kidney images
  * Built with: TensorFlow, Python
  * Uses advanced CNN models for segmentation
  * Deployed using Flask and Nginx
  * Processes DICOM medical images using ImageJ

- VerteVue (vertevue.protosonline.in): A tool for analyzing spine images
  * Built with: PyTorch, OpenCV
  * Uses custom segmentation models
  * Web interface with Django
  * Integrated with hospital PACS systems

- SuVue (suvue.protosonline.in): A system for whole-body tumor detection
  * Built with: TensorFlow, Keras
  * Uses 3D convolution networks
  * Real-time processing capabilities
  * Handles large medical datasets

- DIY AI Platform (diyai.protosonline.in): Lets doctors create AI models without coding
  * Built with: Flask, JavaScript
  * Uses AutoML techniques
  * Drag-and-drop interface
  * Automatic model training and validation

- SIMARA (simara.protosonline.in): A medical chatbot for radiologists
  * Built with: Python, RAG methodology
  * Uses latest LLM technology
  * Integrated with medical databases
  * Real-time response system

All these projects are currently being used by medical professionals, and I've made sure they're easy to use and reliable.

## What I've Achieved
I've built and launched eight different medical AI tools that are being used by doctors right now. I've done well in medical imaging competitions and attended important events like RSNA and Arab Health Expo in 2022 and 2023.

## How I Work
I can speak English, Malayalam, and Hindi, which helps me work well with different teams. I believe in making AI tools that are not just powerful but also practical and easy to use.

## Closing
I love using AI to solve real healthcare problems. I'm always learning new things and looking for ways to make healthcare better through technology. I'd be excited to bring my experience to your team and work on new challenges together.

Thank you for listening!"

# 3-Minute Phone Interview Introduction

"Hello! Thank you for this opportunity. I'm Subin S, a Machine Learning Engineer with three years of specialized experience in medical imaging AI. I completed my B.Tech in Electronics and Communication Engineering from KTU University, Kerala.

In my current role at Aramis Imaging, I've developed several successful AI solutions for healthcare. My most notable project is AIRA, a kidney image analysis system that's actively used by medical professionals. I've also created VerteVue for spine analysis and SuVue for tumor detection, both of which are deployed in clinical settings.

What sets me apart is my experience in building practical AI tools that doctors can actually use. For example, I developed a DIY AI platform that lets medical professionals create their own AI models without coding knowledge. I also built SIMARA, a medical chatbot that helps radiologists in their daily work.

Technically, I'm proficient in Python, TensorFlow, and PyTorch, with strong experience in medical image processing. I've worked with DICOM standards and PACS systems, and I'm comfortable with both model development and deployment using Flask and Django.

I've participated in medical imaging competitions at chaimeleon.grand-challenge.org and attended events like RSNA and Arab Health Expo. To date, I've successfully deployed eight production-level medical AI solutions that are making a real difference in healthcare.

I'm looking for opportunities where I can continue to apply my AI expertise to solve meaningful healthcare challenges. I'm particularly interested in your organization because [customize based on company].

Thank you for your time. I'd be happy to discuss any specific aspects of my experience that interest you."

### Phone Interview Tips:
- Duration: Aim for 2:30-3:00 minutes
- Pace: Speak clearly and at a moderate speed
- Tone: Professional yet enthusiastic
- Focus: Emphasize healthcare AI expertise
- Customize: Adjust the ending based on the specific company
- Ready: Have examples prepared for follow-up questions
