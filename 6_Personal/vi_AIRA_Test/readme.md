## How It Works (Simple Workflow)

1. **Continuous Monitoring**: Every 60 seconds, the system automatically "pings" each of your PACS servers
2. **Health Check**: For each server, it checks if it can connect and get a response
3. **Status Recording**: Records whether each server is UP (working) or DOWN (not responding)
4. **Alert System**: If a server goes down, immediately sends alerts to configured email addresses and Telegram
5. **Dashboard Display**: Shows real-time status of all servers in a user-friendly web interface
6. **Historical Tracking**: Keeps a log of all status changes for troubleshooting and reporting

## Technical Overview

A lightweight, modern, self‑contained monitoring dashboard built with Python's standard library and vanilla JavaScript. It tracks uptime of PACS/Orthanc servers or any HTTP endpoints, provides real-time status updates, and sends alerts when services change state.

**No external dependencies required** - everything runs from this single folder.

## 🚀 Quick Start (For Beginners)

### Step 1: Basic Setup
```cmd
cd path\to\this\folder
python app.py
```

**Server will start and show:**
```
[monitor] 🚀 PACS Monitor Server Started Successfully!
[monitor] 📍 Local access: http://localhost:8080
[monitor] 🌐 Network access: http://192.168.0.25:8080
[monitor] 🔐 Authentication: PROTOS25
[monitor] 🛡️  Security: Enterprise-grade protection enabled
```

### Step 2: Access from Any Device
You can now access the dashboard from:
- **Same computer**: http://localhost:8080
- **Other devices on network**: http://192.168.0.25:8080 (use your actual IP)
- **Mobile phones/tablets**: Same network URL works on mobile devices

### Step 3: Secure Authentication
When you visit the dashboard, you'll see a **secure login screen**:
- **Access Key**: Enter `PROTOS25` (the secret authentication key)
- Click **"Access Dashboard"** 
- **Security Features Active**: The system now uses encrypted sessions and rate limiting

🔒 **Enhanced Security**: 
- All authentication is server-side (cannot be bypassed)
- JavaScript code is completely obfuscated (unreadable in DevTools)  
- Failed login attempts are tracked and IP addresses are temporarily blocked
- Sessions expire automatically for security

### Step 4: Understanding the Enhanced Dashboard

When you access the dashboard (after secure authentication), you'll see:
- **Green cards**: Servers that are working properly (UP)
- **Red cards**: Servers that are having problems (DOWN)  
- **Orange/Yellow cards**: Servers that haven't been checked yet (UNKNOWN)
- **Response times**: How quickly each server responds (lower is better)
- **Enhanced timestamps**: Larger, more readable "Last checked" and "Changed" times
- **Secure logout**: Click the 🚪 Logout button to securely end your session
- **Real-time updates**: Dashboard refreshes automatically with live data

### Step 5: Security Features in Action
- **Code Protection**: Right-click → Inspect Element shows completely obfuscated code
- **Session Security**: Your login is remembered securely until you logout or browser closes
- **Rate Limiting**: Too many failed login attempts will temporarily block access
- **Network Security**: All communication uses secure session tokens (not plain passwords)

### Step 4: Adding Your Own Servers (Secure Process)

1. Click the **"+ Add Service"** button (requires valid session)
2. Fill in the **secure form**:
   - **Name**: A friendly name for your server (e.g., "Main PACS Server")
   - **Host**: The server address (e.g., "medical-server.hospital.com")
   - **Port**: The port number (usually 80, 443, or a custom number like 8042)
   - **Protocol**: Choose "https" (secure) or "http" (standard)
   - **Path**: Usually just leave as "/" (root directory)
3. Click **"Save"** (all data transmitted securely)

Your new server will appear as a card and start being monitored automatically with full security!

## 🔧 Advanced Configuration

### Setting Up Alerts (Optional but Recommended)

To receive notifications when servers go down, you can configure:

#### Email Alerts
Set these environment variables before running the application:
```cmd
set SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
set SMTP_USER=your-email@gmail.com
set SMTP_PASS=your-app-password
set ALERT_EMAIL=alerts@hospital.com
```

#### Telegram Alerts (Popular Choice)
1. Create a Telegram bot by messaging @BotFather
2. Get your chat ID by messaging @userinfobot
3. Set these variables:
```cmd
set TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=123456789:ABCDEF...
set TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=987654321
```

#### Customizing Check Frequency
```cmd
set CHECK_INTERVAL_SEC=30    (check every 30 seconds instead of 60)
set NOTIFY_COOLDOWN_SEC=600  (wait 10 minutes between repeat alerts)
```

### Windows Examples

**Command Prompt (cmd.exe):**
```cmd
set SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
set SMTP_USER=monitor@hospital.com  
set SMTP_PASS=your-password
set ALERT_EMAIL=it-team@hospital.com
set PORT=8080
python app.py
```

**PowerShell:**
```powershell
$env:SMTP_HOST = "smtp.gmail.com"
$env:SMTP_USER = "monitor@hospital.com"
$env:SMTP_PASS = "your-password"
$env:ALERT_EMAIL = "it-team@hospital.com"
python app.py
```

## 🔍 Understanding How the System Works

### The Monitoring Process (Behind the Scenes)

1. **Startup**: When you run `python app.py`, the system:
   - Starts a web server on port 8080
   - Loads your list of servers from `services.json`
   - Begins the monitoring loop in the background

2. **Health Check Process**: Every 60 seconds, for each server:
   - **Step 1**: Try to establish a TCP connection to the server
   - **Step 2**: Send an HTTP request (like opening a webpage)
   - **Step 3**: Check if the server responds within 10 seconds
   - **Step 4**: Record the response time (latency in milliseconds)
   - **Step 5**: Update the server status (UP if responding, DOWN if not)

3. **Status Evaluation**: A server is considered:
   - **UP**: Responds with any HTTP status code from 200-499 (even authentication errors count as "alive")
   - **DOWN**: No response, connection timeout, or HTTP 500+ server errors
   - **UNKNOWN**: Not yet checked since system startup

4. **Alert Logic**: When a server status changes:
   - **UP → DOWN**: Immediately send alert "Server X is down"
   - **DOWN → UP**: Immediately send alert "Server X is back online"
   - **Still DOWN**: Send reminder alerts every 15 minutes (configurable)

## 🚨 Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

| Problem | What You See | Solution |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| All servers show UNKNOWN | Orange/yellow cards, no status | **Wait 60 seconds** - first check cycle hasn't completed yet |
| Server always shows DOWN | Red card, even though server works | Check if server address and port are correct |
| No email alerts | System works but no emails | Verify SMTP settings and check spam folder |
| Telegram not working | No Telegram messages | Double-check bot token and chat ID |
| Can't access dashboard | Browser shows "can't connect" | Make sure `python app.py` is running |
| Dashboard shows old data | Status doesn't update | Click the "↻ Refresh Data" button |

### Testing Your Setup

1. **Test Basic Functionality**:
   ```cmd
   python app.py
   # Should see: [monitor] Serving on http://localhost:8080
   ```

2. **Test Server Connectivity**:
   ```cmd
   python diag.py
   # This will test connections to your configured servers
   ```

3. **Test Dashboard Access**:
   - Open browser to http://localhost:8080
   - Should see cards for all servers (may show UNKNOWN initially)

### Understanding Server Status Codes

When you see numbers like "401", "200", "404" on server cards, these are HTTP response codes:
- **200**: Perfect - server is working normally
- **401**: Good - server is running but requires login (normal for PACS)
- **404**: OK - server is running but page not found (still alive)
- **500+**: Problem - server has internal errors
- **No number**: Server is completely unreachable
