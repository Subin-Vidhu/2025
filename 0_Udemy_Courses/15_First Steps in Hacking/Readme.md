Kali Overview:

- Kali Linux is a Debian-based Linux distribution aimed at advanced Penetration Testing and Security Auditing.
- It comes pre-installed with numerous tools for various information security tasks, such as penetration testing, security research, computer forensics, and reverse engineering.
- Kali Linux is developed and maintained by Offensive Security, a leading organization in the field of information security training and penetration testing services.
- Kali Linux is widely used by security professionals and ethical hackers to conduct security assessments and identify vulnerabilities in systems and networks.
- Kali Linux is available in multiple editions, including a lightweight version for older hardware and a cloud version for use in virtual environments.

- Some of the key features of Kali Linux include:
  - A wide range of pre-installed security tools, organized into categories for easy access.
  - Regular updates and a rolling release model to ensure users have the latest tools and features.
  - Extensive documentation and community support to help users get started and troubleshoot issues.

- Some examples of popular tools included in Kali Linux are:
  - Nmap: A network scanning tool used to discover hosts and services on a computer network.
  - Metasploit: A penetration testing framework that allows security professionals to find and exploit vulnerabilities in systems.
  - Wireshark: A network protocol analyzer that helps users capture and interactively browse network traffic.
  - Burp Suite: A web application security testing tool that provides features for scanning and exploiting vulnerabilities in web applications.

#### Wireshark
- A network protocol analyzer that helps users capture and interactively browse network traffic.

- Examples of use cases for Wireshark include:
  - Analyzing network performance issues by inspecting packet flows and identifying bottlenecks.
  - Troubleshooting connectivity problems by examining the details of network packets.
  - Monitoring network security by capturing and analyzing suspicious traffic patterns.

#### Network Scanning
- The process of identifying active devices on a network and gathering information about their services and vulnerabilities.
- Common tools for network scanning include Nmap and Angry IP Scanner.

- Examples of network scanning techniques include:
  - Ping sweeps to identify live hosts on a network.
  - Port scanning to discover open ports and services running on devices.
  - OS fingerprinting to determine the operating system of a target device.

- nmap (Network Mapper): A powerful open-source tool for network discovery and security auditing. It can be used to perform various types of scans, including host discovery, port scanning, and service enumeration.

- example of nmap: nmap -sP 192.168.1.0/24, gives a list of all active devices on the specified subnet.

#### Bruteforce Attacks
- A method used to gain unauthorized access to accounts or systems by systematically trying all possible combinations of passwords or encryption keys.
- Common tools for brute force attacks include Hydra and John the Ripper.

- Examples of brute force attack techniques include:
  - Password guessing using a list of common passwords.
  - Credential stuffing using leaked username/password pairs.
  - Dictionary attacks that use a list of words or phrases to guess passwords.

- hydra: A popular password cracking tool that supports various protocols and services, allowing users to perform rapid dictionary attacks.

    - `hydra -l admin -P /path/to/password/list.txt ftp://target-ip`

#### Metasploit
- A penetration testing framework that allows security professionals to find and exploit vulnerabilities in systems.
- Commonly used for developing and executing exploit code against a remote target machine.
- Provides a wide range of tools for tasks such as information gathering, vulnerability scanning, and post-exploitation.

- Examples of Metasploit modules include:
  - Exploits for known vulnerabilities in software and services.
  - Payloads for establishing a reverse shell or other forms of remote access.
  - Auxiliary modules for tasks such as scanning and enumeration.

- msfconsole: The command-line interface for interacting with the Metasploit Framework.
