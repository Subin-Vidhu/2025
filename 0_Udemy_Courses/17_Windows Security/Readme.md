- Windows Securtiy app in Desktop

    - Windows Security app is a built-in security app in Windows 10 and Windows 11 that helps protect your device from malware, viruses, and other threats.
    - It provides real-time protection, firewall and network protection, account protection, device performance and health monitoring, and family options.
    - The app is designed to work seamlessly with Windows Defender Antivirus, which is also built into Windows 10 and Windows 11.
    - The app is easy to use and provides a simple interface for managing your device's security settings.

    - The app is regularly updated by Microsoft to ensure that it provides the latest protection against emerging threats.
    - The app is free and comes pre-installed with Windows 10 and Windows 11.

- UAC (User Account Control)

    - UAC is a security feature in Windows that helps prevent unauthorized changes to your computer.
    - It does this by prompting you for permission or an administrator password before allowing certain actions to be performed.
    - UAC is designed to help protect your computer from malware and other malicious software that may try to make changes to your system without your knowledge or consent.
    - UAC is enabled by default in Windows 10 and Windows 11, and it is recommended that you keep it enabled to help protect your computer.

    - You can adjust the UAC settings to control how often you are prompted for permission or an administrator password.
    - You can also choose to disable UAC, but this is not recommended as it can leave your computer vulnerable to security threats.

- Firewall

    - A firewall is a network security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules.
    - A firewall can be hardware-based, software-based, or a combination of both.
    - The primary purpose of a firewall is to prevent unauthorized access to or from a private network while allowing legitimate communication to pass through.
    - Firewalls can be used to protect individual devices, such as computers and smartphones, as well as entire networks, such as corporate networks and data centers.

    - Firewalls can be configured to block or allow specific types of traffic based on criteria such as IP address, port number, protocol, and application.
    - Firewalls can also be used to monitor network traffic for suspicious activity and alert administrators to potential security threats.

- Anti Virus

    - Antivirus software is a program designed to detect, prevent, and remove malicious software (malware) from a computer or network.
    - Antivirus software typically uses a combination of signature-based detection, heuristic analysis, and behavioral analysis to identify and block malware.
    - Signature-based detection involves comparing files on a computer to a database of known malware signatures. If a file matches a known signature, it is flagged as malware and either quarantined or deleted.
    - Heuristic analysis involves analyzing the behavior of files and programs to identify potential malware based on patterns of behavior that are commonly associated with malware.

    - Behavioral analysis involves monitoring the behavior of programs and files in real-time to identify suspicious activity that may indicate the presence of malware.
    - Antivirus software is typically updated regularly to ensure that it can detect the latest threats.

- Real World Hacking Examples

    - Phishing Attacks: Attackers send fraudulent emails or messages that appear to be from a legitimate source, such as a bank or social media platform, in order to trick users into providing sensitive information, such as passwords or credit card numbers.
    - Ransomware Attacks: Attackers use malware to encrypt a victim's files and demand payment in exchange for the decryption key. This type of attack can be devastating for individuals and organizations alike.
    - Social Engineering Attacks: Attackers use psychological manipulation to trick users into divulging sensitive information or performing actions that compromise security. This can include tactics such as pretexting, baiting, and tailgating

    - eg: using msfvenom to create a payload and using social engineering to trick the victim into executing it. Example: sending a fake invoice or a link to a malicious website that exploits a vulnerability in the victim's browser or operating system.

- Windows Sandbox 

    - Windows Sandbox is a lightweight virtual machine that allows you to run untrusted applications in a secure environment without affecting your main operating system.
    - It is available in Windows 10 Pro and Enterprise editions, as well as Windows 11 Pro and Enterprise editions.
    - When you run an application in Windows Sandbox, it creates a temporary instance of Windows that is isolated from your main operating system. Any changes made to the sandbox environment are discarded when you close the sandbox.
    - This makes it a useful tool for testing potentially harmful applications or files without risking damage to your main operating system.

    - Windows Sandbox is easy to use and requires no additional configuration. Simply open the Windows Sandbox application, and a new instance of Windows will be created automatically.
    - You can copy and paste files between your main operating system and the sandbox environment, making it easy to test applications or files that you may not trust.
